The Time Management Application is a tool designed to assist students in effectively managing their tasks and completing assignments on time. It addresses the common challenges students face in determining how much time to allocate to each task, especially when working on assessments.
Features

- Task Input: Users can input the number of tasks they have and specify the difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) for each task. This information helps in determining the appropriate duration for each task.
- Calculation Mechanism: The application utilizes a calculation mechanism that considers the difficulty level and predefined weightages assigned to different task categories. Easy tasks are assigned a weightage of 0.5, medium tasks have a weightage of 0.75, and hard tasks have a weightage of 1.0.
- Time Allocation: Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application calculates the appropriate duration in minutes or hours that should be allocated to each task category. This ensures a balanced workload and efficient time management.
- Total Available Minutes: Users are prompted to provide the total available Minutes they have to complete the assessment. This information is considered in the calculation process to determine the task durations accurately.
- Improved Time Management: By providing a structured approach and guiding users in allocating the right amount of time to each task category, the application helps students improve their time management skills.
- Reduced Stress: The application aims to alleviate the stress associated with completing assignments on time by enabling students to effectively distribute their available time resources.
