Introduction:
The completed time management application is a comprehensive solution designed to address the common challenges students face in managing their tasks and completing assignments on time. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the application provides students with the tools they need to effectively allocate their time and stay organized throughout their academic journey.
The application takes into account the difficulties students encounter when determining how much time to allocate to each task, particularly when working on assessments. By prompting users to input the number of tasks and specify their difficulty levels, the application offers a tailored approach to time allocation. It calculates the appropriate duration for each task category based on predefined weightages assigned to different difficulty levels.
Not only does the application assist students in managing their time effectively, but it also encourages them to develop essential time management skills. By providing a structured approach to task allocation and workload distribution, it empowers students to achieve a balanced workload and improve their overall productivity.
With the completion of this project, students now have access to a reliable and intuitive time management tool that can significantly alleviate the stress associated with meeting assignment deadlines. By enabling students to make better use of their available time resources, the application promotes better academic performance and a healthier work-life balance.
Overall, the completed time management application represents a valuable asset for students seeking to enhance their organizational skills, meet deadlines, and achieve their academic goals. Its user-centric design and functionality make it an indispensable tool in the arsenal of any student looking to optimize their time and succeed in their studies.
Methodology:
For the development of this individual project, an Agile methodology, specifically the Scrum framework, was chosen. Although Scrum is typically used in team-based projects, it can be adapted to suit the needs of a single developer.
The Scrum methodology provides a structured approach to project management, emphasizing iterative development, frequent feedback, and continuous improvement. As the sole developer of the application, the Scrum framework was modified to suit the individual project requirements.
Key elements of the adapted Scrum methodology for this project include:
1. Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features and functionalities was created as the product backlog. This served as a comprehensive list of requirements and user stories for the application.
2. Sprints: Iterative development cycles, known as sprints, were employed to focus on specific deliverables within a fixed timeframe. Each sprint had a duration ,allowing for regular progress updates and feedback.

3. Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, a sprint planning session was conducted to select user stories from the product backlog for implementation. These user stories defined the scope of work for the sprint.
5. Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, a sprint review was conducted to demonstrate the completed features and gather feedback. This allowed for continuous improvement and ensured that the application aligned with user expectations.
6. Sprint Retrospective: A sprint retrospective was conducted after each sprint to reflect on the development process and identify areas for improvement. This feedback was used to refine future sprints and enhance the overall development approach.

Methods:
To evaluate the solution, a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods was employed. The following methods were chosen to ensure a comprehensive and insightful evaluation:
